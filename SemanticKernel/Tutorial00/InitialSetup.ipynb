    "In this brief tutorial, we'll make sure you get everything set up so you can run the other notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, you'll need Visual Studio Code. You'll also need the Polyglot extension from Microsoft.\n",
    "2. In order to make progress in these tutorials, you must have either Azure OpenAI Service provisioned and/or established an OpenAI account.\n",
    "3. Find the **config** folder and add a new file there named **settings.json**.\n",
    "4. In the settings.json file you just created, paste the following code and replace the text within square brackets with your own settings. (Remember you only to populate either AzureOpenAI or OpenAI settings.): \n",
    "``` json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"Type\": \"azure\", \n",
    "    \"AzureOpenAI\": {\n",
    "        \"Endpoint\": \"[the endpoint URL from your Azure OpenAI Service instance]\", \n",
    "        \"ApiKey\": \"[key from your Azure OpenAI Service instance.]\", \n",
    "        \"CompletionsDeployment\": \"[insert the name of a deployment in your Azure OpenAI instance.]\"\n",
    "    }, \n",
    "    \"OpenAI\": {\n",
    "        \"ApiKey\": \"[the key from your OpenAI instance]\", \n",
    "        \"OrgId\": \"[the organization ID from your OpenAI instance]\", \n",
    "        \"Model\": \"[insert the name of the model you are using from OpenAI]\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the **type** setting above, you can enter *azure* to specify you want to use Azure OpenAI Service or *openai* if you want to use OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are connecting to an instance of the Azure OpenAI Service, you have to set:\n",
    "- **AzureOpenAI Endpoint** In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Overview** page of your Azure OpenAI instance. Copy the Endpoint URL to your clipboard and paste the value into your settings.json.\n",
    "- **AzureOpenAIApiKey** In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Keys and Endpoint** page of your Azure OpenAI instance. Copy the **KEY 1** value to your clipboard and paste the value into your settings.json.\n",
    "- **deployment** In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Model Deployments** page of your Azure OpenAI instance. Click the **Manage Deployments** button to navigate to Azure AI Studio and the **Deployments** page. If you haven't already, create a new deployment and select the text-davinci-003 model. Give your deployment a name and paste the value into your settings.json.\n",
    "Else if you are connecting directly to the OpenAI APIs, first navigate to [this](https://platform.openai.com/) and log in using your Microsoft account.\n",
    "- **ApiKey** In your browser, navigate to [this](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) web page. Copy one of your API keys from the web page to your clipboard and paste the value into your settings.json.\n",
    "- **Organization** In your browser, navigate to [this](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings). Copy the organization ID from the web page to your clipboard and paste the value into your settings.json.\n",
    "- **Model** In your browser, navigate to [this](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). You can (and should) explore the various models available from OpenAI, but for most of these tutorials, I recommend starting with text-davinci-003. Copy your chosen model to your clipboard and paste the value into your settings.json."
