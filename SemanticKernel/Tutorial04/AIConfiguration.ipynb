    "OpenAI has defined some settings you can use to change the behavior of the Large Language Model's response in both subtle and less subtle ways. Whether you aren't getting the response you expected or you think you can maybe get a slightly better response, these configuration options may be a good place to look."

    "You'll first need to create a PromptTemplateConfig object. Within that object, you'll need to define the Completion property and it has all of the configuration options for changing the completion generated. These options include: \n",
    "- **MaxTokens** This option is of critical importance for three reasons:\n",
    "-- each LLM model has a maximum number of tokens that can be used per API request. When estimating tokens, think 1 token is approximately 4 characters in English words. For a GPT model, the tokens in the prompt plus the tokens in the generated completion must be less than your chosen model's maximum token length. GPT-3 models are limited to 2,049 tokens, but GPT-4 can go all the way up to 32,768 tokens! Read more about models and their differences [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n",
    "-- OpenAI also has a rate limit. This means you can only make so many requests per tokens every minute. Read more [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview).\n",
    "-- the number of tokens generated by OpenAI directly corresponds to the monetary cost to you! Read more [here](https://openai.com/pricing). \n",
    "- **Temperature** This can be set as low as 0.0 or as high as 2.0. A higher temperature allows the model to generate more \"creative\" completions. A lower temperature has the opposite effect and completions are more deterministic (though not entirely deterministic!) When generating creative works, you probably want a higher temperature, but when converting one language to another, you probably want a lower temperature.\n",
    "- **TopP** Unlike Temperature, the range of this setting is 0.0 to 1.0. When the model generates possible options for the next token, TopP limits the number of the likeliest options. In practice, TopP has a similar \"randomizing\" effect as Temperature. Both settings can be used together.\n",
    "- **FrequencyPenalty** This can be set as low as 0.0 or as high as 2.0. Setting this value higher discourages the model from repeating words in the generated completion.\n",
    "- **PresencePenalty** This can be set as low as 0.0 or as high as 2.0. Setting this value higher encourages the model to generate tokens not already generated previously. Though similar to the frequency penalty, note the difference between frequency of words and presence of tokens - where tokens are often parts of words.\n",
    "- **StopSequences** Stop sequences are a list of characters like \"\\n\" or \"###\" though you can define anything you want here. This setting can be a little confusing until you play with it. For some completions, the LLM will generate tokens until it hits max tokens, but if you want it to stop generating tokens at a certain point, you can enter stop sequences in your prompt to control this."
